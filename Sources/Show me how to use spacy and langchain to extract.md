# Show me how to use spacy and langchain to extract globally disambiguated entities from a text, divide them into organizations, persons, places and other suitable categories. For persons also recognize their roles and relationship to organizations and places

To extract globally disambiguated entities from text, categorize them (organizations, persons, places, etc.), and for persons, recognize roles and relationships to organizations and places using spaCy and LangChain, you can combine the strengths of both libraries. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

## 1. Extract Entities with spaCy

spaCy provides robust out-of-the-box Named Entity Recognition (NER) models that can identify entities such as PERSON, ORG (organization), and GPE (geopolitical entity/place)[^1_1][^1_2][^1_7]. Here’s how to use spaCy for entity extraction:

```python
import spacy

# Load a large, accurate model for better results
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")  # Or "en_core_web_trf" for transformer-based accuracy

text = "Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and lives in California."

doc = nlp(text)

entities = []
for ent in doc.ents:
    entities.append({'text': ent.text, 'label': ent.label_})

print(entities)
# Output: [{'text': 'Tim Cook', 'label': 'PERSON'}, {'text': 'CEO', 'label': 'ORG'}, ...]
```

spaCy will categorize entities into types like PERSON, ORG, GPE, etc. You can further group them:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

grouped_entities = defaultdict(list)
for ent in doc.ents:
    grouped_entities[ent.label_].append(ent.text)

print(grouped_entities)
# Example: {'PERSON': ['Tim Cook'], 'ORG': ['Apple'], 'GPE': ['California']}
```


## 2. Disambiguate Entities Globally

spaCy’s default NER does not perform true global disambiguation (i.e., linking “Apple” to the company Apple Inc. vs. the fruit). For this, you can use spaCy’s Entity Linking pipeline (available in some models) or integrate with external knowledge bases (like Wikidata) for entity linking[^1_3]. For advanced use, consider spaCy’s `spacy-llm` or third-party packages for entity linking[^1_3].

## 3. Extract Roles and Relationships with LangChain

LangChain excels at extracting structured relationships using LLMs and custom schemas. You can define a schema to extract not just entities, but also roles and relationships[^1_4][^1_5].

**Example schema using Pydantic:**

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: Optional[str]
    role: Optional[str]
    organization: Optional[str]
    location: Optional[str]

class ExtractionResult(BaseModel):
    persons: List[Person]
    organizations: List[str]
    places: List[str]
    others: List[str]
```

**Prompt the LLM to extract structured information:**

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

llm = OpenAI()
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["text"],
    template="Extract all persons, their roles, organizations, and places from the following text: {text}"
)

# Use LangChain's extraction chain
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(schema=ExtractionResult)
result = structured_llm.invoke(prompt_template.invoke({"text": text}))

print(result)
```

This will output structured data, e.g.:

```python
ExtractionResult(
    persons=[Person(name="Tim Cook", role="CEO", organization="Apple", location="California")],
    organizations=["Apple"],
    places=["California"],
    others=[]
)
```


## 4. Combine spaCy and LangChain

- Use spaCy for fast, high-precision initial entity extraction and categorization.
- Use LangChain (with LLMs) to extract deeper relationships (roles, affiliations, locations) and to globally disambiguate entities by leveraging LLM knowledge and prompt engineering[^1_4][^1_5].
- Optionally, use spaCy’s entity linking for further disambiguation if available[^1_3].


## Summary Table: Comparison of Tasks

| Task | spaCy | LangChain/LLM |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Basic Entity Extraction | Yes (fast, accurate) | Yes (via LLM, flexible) |
| Entity Categorization | Yes | Yes |
| Global Entity Disambiguation | Limited (needs extra pipeline) | Yes (via LLM, with prompt) |
| Extracting Roles/Relationships | Limited (needs custom pipeline) | Yes (define schema in prompt) |
| Structured Output | No (needs post-processing) | Yes (direct schema output) |

## Example Workflow

1. Use spaCy to extract and categorize entities.
2. Feed the text and/or spaCy results to LangChain with a schema to extract roles and relationships.
3. Optionally, use spaCy’s entity linking or LLM-based prompts for global disambiguation.

This approach leverages spaCy’s speed and accuracy for basic NER, and LangChain’s LLM-powered flexibility for extracting nuanced relationships and resolving ambiguities[^1_1][^1_2][^1_4][^1_5][^1_7].

# Give me an example script to do this task for .txt files using a locally installed ollama model

Here’s a complete example script that uses **spaCy** for initial entity extraction and **LangChain** with a locally running **Ollama** model (such as Llama 3) to perform global entity disambiguation, categorize entities, and extract roles and relationships for persons from `.txt` files.

This script assumes you have:

- Installed and started Ollama with a supported model (e.g., `ollama pull llama3.1` and `ollama serve`) [^2_1][^2_2][^2_11]
- Installed the required Python packages:
`pip install spacy langchain langchain-ollama`
- Downloaded a spaCy English model:
`python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg`

```python
import os
import spacy
from langchain_ollama.llms import OllamaLLM
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# --- 1. Load spaCy model ---
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")

# --- 2. Read .txt file ---
file_path = "your_file.txt"
with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()

# --- 3. Extract entities with spaCy ---
doc = nlp(text)
entities = []
for ent in doc.ents:
    entities.append({"text": ent.text, "label": ent.label_})

# --- 4. Prepare prompt for LLM disambiguation and relationship extraction ---
entity_summary = "\n".join([f"{e['text']} ({e['label']})" for e in entities])
llm_prompt = f"""
Given the following extracted entities from a document:

{entity_summary}

And the document text:
\"\"\"
{text}
\"\"\"

1. For each entity, globally disambiguate it (e.g., link 'Apple' to 'Apple Inc.' or 'the fruit').
2. Categorize all entities into: Organizations, Persons, Places, and Others.
3. For each Person, identify their role (e.g., CEO, founder) and their relationships to Organizations and Places, if mentioned.
4. Return the result as a structured JSON object with this format:
{{
    "organizations": [{{"name": "...", "disambiguation": "..."}}, ...],
    "persons": [
        {{
            "name": "...",
            "disambiguation": "...",
            "role": "...",
            "organizations": ["..."],
            "places": ["..."]
        }},
        ...
    ],
    "places": [{{"name": "...", "disambiguation": "..."}}, ...],
    "others": [{{"name": "...", "disambiguation": "..."}}, ...]
}}
"""

# --- 5. Set up LangChain with Ollama ---
llm = OllamaLLM(model="llama3.1")  # Use your pulled model name

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("{prompt}")
chain = prompt | llm

# --- 6. Run the LLM chain ---
result = chain.invoke({"prompt": llm_prompt})

# --- 7. Output the result ---
print(result)
```

**Notes:**

- This script first uses spaCy to extract entities and their types.
- It then constructs a detailed prompt for the Ollama-powered LLM via LangChain, asking for global disambiguation, categorization, and relationship extraction in structured JSON.
- The result should be a JSON object with organizations, persons (with roles and relationships), places, and others, all globally disambiguated.

**Customization:**

- Adjust the prompt for more/less detail as needed.
- For batch processing, loop over multiple `.txt` files.

**References:**

- [Ollama and LangChain integration][^2_1][^2_2][^2_11]
- [spaCy usage][^2_4][^2_6][^2_8]

This workflow combines spaCy’s precision in entity extraction with the reasoning and world knowledge of a local LLM for robust, globally disambiguated, and categorized entity analysis.

# Use langchain to first divide the document into semantic chunks of suitable length for processing, while maintaining topic coherence

To divide a document into semantic chunks of suitable length while maintaining topic coherence using LangChain, you should use its **text splitters**-especially the **SemanticChunker** or the **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** with sentence-level granularity. These tools are designed to keep semantically related content together, optimizing for both chunk size and coherence[^3_1][^3_4].

Below is a practical example using LangChain’s `SemanticChunker`, which first splits text into sentences and then groups sentences into chunks based on semantic similarity. This approach is ideal for maintaining topic coherence.

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import SemanticChunker
from langchain_core.documents import Document

# Load your document (as a string)
with open("your_file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()

# Wrap the text in a Document object
doc = Document(page_content=text)

# Initialize the SemanticChunker
# You can adjust chunk_size and overlap for your use case
chunker = SemanticChunker(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)  # size in words or tokens

# Split the document into semantic chunks
chunks = chunker.split_documents([doc])

# Each chunk is a Document object; get the text with .page_content
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"--- Chunk {i+1} ---")
    print(chunk.page_content)
    print()
```

**Key Points:**

- `SemanticChunker` keeps sentences together if they are semantically similar, resulting in coherent topic-based chunks[^3_1].
- Adjust `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` to fit your LLM’s context window and desired granularity.
- For most general text, this method is recommended for starting out[^3_1][^3_4].

**Alternative:**
If you don’t have access to the SemanticChunker (it may be experimental or require additional setup), `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is the next best option. It attempts to split on paragraphs, then sentences, then words, preserving coherence as much as possible[^3_1][^3_4].

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
chunks = splitter.split_documents([doc])
```

**Summary Table of Splitters:**


| Splitter Name | Maintains Topic Coherence | Usage Scenario |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| SemanticChunker | Yes | General text, topic-based chunking |
| RecursiveCharacter | Partial | General text, fallback if semantic not available |
| Markdown/HTML/Code | Yes (for those formats) | Structured documents |

**References:**

- LangChain documentation on text splitters and semantic chunking[^3_1][^3_4][^3_6].

This approach ensures your document is processed into contextually meaningful, LLM-ready chunks.

# Use the local ollama llm to chunk the text semantically not only on sentences, but also on larger paragraphs based on their content

To semantically chunk text into both sentences and larger coherent paragraphs using a **local Ollama LLM** for embeddings, you can use LangChain’s `SemanticChunker` with the `OllamaEmbeddings` class. This method analyzes the content and adaptively splits the document at points where the semantic similarity between sections drops, resulting in chunks that preserve topic coherence-often aligning with paragraphs or multi-sentence ideas, not just single sentences[^4_1][^4_3][^4_7].

Below is a Python example script that reads a `.txt` file, uses Ollama for embeddings, and produces semantically coherent chunks:

```python
from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker
from langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings

# Read your text file
with open("your_file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()

# Set up Ollama embeddings (make sure Ollama is running locally)
embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="nomic-embed-text")  # Use your preferred embedding model

# Initialize the semantic chunker
chunker = SemanticChunker(
    embeddings,
    breakpoint_threshold_type="percentile",  # Adaptive thresholding
    # Optionally, tune the percentile, e.g., breakpoint_percentile_threshold=85
)

# Create semantic chunks
docs = chunker.create_documents([text])

# Print out each chunk
for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
    print(f"--- Chunk {i+1} ---")
    print(doc.page_content)
    print()
```

**How it works:**

- The `SemanticChunker` first splits the text into sentences, then groups sentences into larger chunks based on semantic similarity in the embedding space[^4_1][^4_7].
- If several sentences or a paragraph are closely related, they are kept together as one chunk.
- The chunker adaptively determines breakpoints, so chunks may be single sentences, full paragraphs, or multi-paragraph sections, depending on the content’s coherence[^4_5][^4_6].

**Tips:**

- You can tweak the `breakpoint_percentile_threshold` parameter to control how sensitive the chunker is to topic changes (higher values = larger, more coherent chunks).
- This approach is ideal for RAG and downstream LLM tasks, as it preserves the integrity of ideas and topics[^4_6].

**Requirements:**

- `langchain-experimental` and `langchain-community` packages
- A running local Ollama server with the chosen embedding model (like `nomic-embed-text`)

This method ensures your document is split into semantically meaningful, context-rich chunks suitable for advanced LLM processing.

# Is it necessary to use the community module for embeddings or would it not be possible to do the same task using the core functions of langchain?

It is necessary to use the **community module** (such as `langchain_community.embeddings`) for most embedding model integrations, including local models like Ollama. The reason is that **`langchain-core` only provides abstract interfaces and base classes for embeddings**, not concrete implementations or integrations with specific models[^5_1][^5_2][^5_6].

The **core module** defines the `Embeddings` interface and related utilities, but **actual implementations for embedding providers (OpenAI, Ollama, HuggingFace, etc.) are located in the community module**[^5_1][^5_2][^5_5]. This modular design allows LangChain to keep the core lightweight and stable, while integrations with external or third-party models are maintained in `langchain-community`[^5_1].

**In summary:**

- You cannot use only `langchain-core` to generate embeddings with local Ollama or other real models.
- You must use the community module (e.g., `langchain_community.embeddings.OllamaEmbeddings`) to access actual embedding functionality for local or third-party models[^5_1][^5_5].

This separation is intentional and is part of LangChain's new architecture to streamline maintenance and support a wide range of integrations[^5_1].

# Is the langchain community module safe? It has very few interactions on github

The **langchain-community** module is a key part of the LangChain ecosystem, providing third-party integrations (including embedding models, vector stores, and APIs) that implement the interfaces defined in `langchain-core`[^6_2][^6_4]. Its purpose is to keep the core package lightweight and stable while enabling rapid development and support for a wide range of external tools and providers.

### Security and Trustworthiness

- **Open Source and Actively Maintained:** The module is open source and maintained as part of the official LangChain project[^6_2][^6_4][^6_8]. It is published on PyPI and uploaded using trusted publishing methods[^6_2].
- **Intended Use:** It is designed for developers who want to quickly integrate external or community-supported tools into LangChain applications[^6_2].
- **Security Practices:** LangChain documentation emphasizes best practices for security when using integrations, such as limiting permissions and sandboxing, especially when connecting to external resources[^6_5]. This advice applies to all integrations, including those in the community module.
- **Vulnerabilities:** As with any open-source project, vulnerabilities can occasionally be discovered (for example, a recent XML parser issue was noted in a different part of LangChain[^6_6]). However, there are no widespread reports of critical security issues specific to the `langchain-community` module itself in the provided results.


### Community Activity

- **Low GitHub Interaction:** It is true that some parts of the module may have fewer interactions or stars compared to the main `langchain` repository. This is partly because the community module is newer and serves as a collection of integrations, which may each have varying levels of usage and visibility.
- **Contributions:** The project is open to contributions, and its modular nature means that some integrations may be more mature and widely used than others[^6_2].


### Practical Considerations

- **Standard Practice:** Using a separate module for integrations is a standard approach in many Python ecosystems to keep the core stable and allow for faster iteration on third-party connectors.
- **Responsibility:** As with any package that connects to external systems, you should review the code and restrict permissions as appropriate for your application, especially in production environments[^6_5].

---

**Summary:**
The `langchain-community` module is an official, open-source part of the LangChain project, designed to provide integrations with external tools. While some integrations may have less community interaction, the module itself follows standard security and publishing practices, and there are no major security concerns reported in the search results. As always, follow best practices for securing your application when using any third-party integrations[^6_2][^6_5][^6_4].

# For the previously generated chunking script, implement a functionality to check whether the process is still active or otherwise monitor progress

To monitor the progress or activity of your chunking script, you can implement a **progress indicator** within the script itself, and/or use external process monitoring tools. Here are two practical approaches you can combine for robust monitoring:

---

## 1. **In-Script Progress Monitoring**

If your script processes a large document and splits it into semantic chunks, you can add a progress bar using the `tqdm` library or print progress updates as each chunk is created. This gives you immediate feedback on the script's status.

**Example with tqdm:**

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

# ... (after you have your list of sentences or paragraphs)
chunks = []
total = len(sentences)  # or paragraphs, depending on your splitting logic

for i in tqdm(range(0, total, chunk_size)):
    chunk = sentences[i:i+chunk_size]
    # process chunk as needed
    chunks.append(chunk)
```

Or, if using a high-level chunker that processes in one go but is slow, print status before/after:

```python
import time

print("Starting semantic chunking...")
start = time.time()
docs = chunker.create_documents([text])
print(f"Chunking complete. {len(docs)} chunks created in {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds.")
```


---

## 2. **External Process Monitoring**

If you want to check whether the script is still running from outside (for example, in another terminal), use the `psutil` library to monitor the process by its PID. This is useful for long-running jobs or when running scripts in the background.

**Example monitor script:**

```python
import psutil
import time

# Replace with your script's PID
pid = 12345

try:
    process = psutil.Process(pid)
    while True:
        if process.is_running():
            print(f"Process {pid} is running. Status: {process.status()}")
        else:
            print(f"Process {pid} is not running.")
            break
        time.sleep(5)
except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
    print(f"Process {pid} does not exist.")
```

This script checks the status every 5 seconds and reports if the process is still active[^7_2][^7_3][^7_1].

---

## 3. **Combined Example: In-Script Progress + External Monitoring**

- Add progress updates inside your chunking script.
- Use an external monitor (like the above) to check if the process is alive and optionally log resource usage.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Method | Implementation | When to Use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| In-script progress bar | tqdm/print statements | User wants live feedback in script |
| External monitoring | psutil | Monitor from outside, log status |


---

**Tip:**
For robust production use, combine both: show progress in the script and monitor the process externally (or even set up automatic restarts if needed[^7_6]). This ensures you always know if your chunking job is active and how far along it is.

# Is it possible to store the embeddings generated this way to avoid having to generate them again?

Yes, it is absolutely possible-and recommended-to store the embeddings generated during chunking to avoid recomputing them in the future. This is a core use case for **vector stores** in LangChain and similar frameworks.

## How to Store and Reuse Embeddings

- **Vector stores** (such as Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone, LanceDB, etc.) are designed to persistently store both your text chunks and their corresponding embeddings. Once stored, you can reload the vector store and perform similarity search or retrieval without needing to recompute embeddings each time[^8_1][^8_3][^8_6][^8_7].
- LangChain also provides **embedding caching** mechanisms (e.g., `CacheBackedEmbeddings`) to avoid recomputation, even outside of a vector store[^8_4].


### Example with Persistent Vector Store (Chroma)

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma

# Storing embeddings
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings, persist_directory="./chroma_db")
vectorstore.persist()  # Save to disk

# Later, reload and reuse without recomputing
vectorstore = Chroma(persist_directory="./chroma_db", embedding_function=embeddings)
results = vectorstore.similarity_search("your query")
```

This allows you to store your embeddings once and reuse them across sessions or deployments[^8_3][^8_6].

### Example with Embedding Cache

```python
from langchain.embeddings import CacheBackedEmbeddings
from langchain.storage import InMemoryByteStore

store = InMemoryByteStore()
cached_embedder = CacheBackedEmbeddings.from_bytes_store(underlying_embeddings, store, namespace="my_model")
```

This approach caches embeddings in memory or on disk, further reducing redundant computation[^8_4].

---

**In summary:**
Storing embeddings in a persistent vector store or using an embedding cache is fully supported and best practice in LangChain. This avoids unnecessary recomputation, speeds up your pipeline, and enables scalable retrieval workflows[^8_1][^8_3][^8_4][^8_6][^8_7].

# Is it possible to effectively store embeddings as RDF?

You can store embeddings alongside RDF data, but **RDF is not inherently designed to store high-dimensional numerical vectors** like those produced by embedding models. However, there are practical approaches to integrating embeddings with RDF, and this is an active area of research and development.

## Key Points

- **Embeddings as RDF Literals:**
Embeddings can technically be stored as RDF literals (e.g., as a long comma-separated string or as a list of numbers). This method is possible but not efficient for large-scale similarity search or vector operations, as RDF triplestores are optimized for graph queries, not vector math[^9_4][^9_8].
- **Hybrid Approaches:**
A common and effective strategy is to store the *relationship* between an RDF entity and its embedding in RDF, but keep the actual vector in a dedicated vector store (such as FAISS, Chroma, or Pinecone). The RDF graph can then reference the vector by URI or identifier, enabling integration between semantic queries and vector search[^9_2][^9_5][^9_3].
- **Augmented Knowledge Graphs:**
Research shows that combining RDF data with embedding models (e.g., RDF2Vec, TransE) enhances knowledge graph applications. The embeddings are generated from the RDF graph and can be reused for downstream tasks, but the actual storage and retrieval of vectors for similarity search is typically handled outside the RDF store[^9_2][^9_3][^9_5].

> "We integrated RDF data with vector space models to construct an augmented knowledge graph... the vector embeddings not only can be used in machine learning tasks, but also for document modeling and recommender systems, without a need to retrain the embedding models." [^9_2][^9_3][^9_5]

- **Practical Considerations:**
    - RDF triplestores are excellent for storing semantic relationships and metadata.
    - For efficient vector search and retrieval, use a vector database and link entities between the RDF graph and the vector store.
    - Some experimental systems and research projects explore storing vectors directly in RDF, but this is not common in production due to performance limitations.


## Summary Table

| Approach | Efficient for Vector Search | RDF Standards-Compliant | Used in Practice |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Store vectors as RDF literals | ❌ | ✔️ | Rare |
| Store references to vectors in RDF | ✔️ | ✔️ | Common |
| Store all in vector DB, no RDF | ✔️ | ❌ | Common |
| Hybrid: RDF for graph, vector DB for vectors | ✔️ | ✔️ | Recommended |

## Conclusion

- **You can store embeddings as RDF literals, but this is not efficient or common for large-scale applications.**
- **The most effective approach is to use RDF to describe entities and their relationships, and link these to embedding vectors stored in a specialized vector database.**
- This hybrid method leverages the strengths of both technologies: semantic querying with RDF and fast vector search with vector stores[^9_2][^9_3][^9_5].

# In the chunking script, store the embeddings in a weaviate database running in docker with its port exposed to localhost. Explain to me how this works and how the embeddings are formatted.

Here’s how to store embeddings from your chunking script in a **Weaviate** vector database running in Docker, and an explanation of how this works and how embeddings are formatted.

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Weaviate Setup with Docker**

- **Weaviate** is a vector database that stores both objects (your text chunks) and their vector embeddings for fast similarity search.
- You run Weaviate locally in Docker, exposing port 8080 to localhost for API access[^10_5][^10_7][^10_8].

**Example Docker command:**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 semitechnologies/weaviate:latest
```

Or, with `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.4'
services:
  weaviate:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:1.30.2
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 50051:50051
    environment:
      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25
      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'true'
      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'
      ENABLE_API_BASED_MODULES: 'true'
      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: 'node1'
    volumes:
      - weaviate_data:/var/lib/weaviate
volumes:
  weaviate_data:
```

Start with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Your Weaviate instance is now accessible at `http://localhost:8080`[^10_5][^10_7][^10_8].

---

### **2. Storing Embeddings in Weaviate**

- **Python clients** (like the `weaviate` package) let you connect to Weaviate and upload both your text and its embedding.
- **Embeddings** are stored as lists of floating-point numbers (e.g., `[0.123, -0.456, ...]`) in the vector field of each object.
- You create a **class** (think: table/schema) in Weaviate for your chunks, then add each chunk as an object with its embedding.

---

## **Example Python Script**

Below is a simplified script that:

- Chunks your text.
- Generates embeddings (using any model, e.g., Ollama).
- Stores each chunk and its embedding in Weaviate.

```python
import weaviate
from langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings
from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker

# 1. Connect to Weaviate
client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")

# 2. Create a class/schema for your chunks if it doesn't exist
class_obj = {
    "class": "TextChunk",
    "vectorizer": "none",  # We'll supply our own vectors
    "properties": [
        {"name": "content", "dataType": ["text"]},
    ]
}
if not client.schema.exists("TextChunk"):
    client.schema.create_class(class_obj)

# 3. Chunk your text
with open("your_file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()
embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="nomic-embed-text")
chunker = SemanticChunker(embeddings)
chunks = chunker.create_documents([text])

# 4. Store each chunk and its embedding in Weaviate
for chunk in chunks:
    embedding = embeddings.embed_documents([chunk.page_content])[^10_0]  # list of floats
    properties = {"content": chunk.page_content}
    client.data_object.create(
        properties=properties,
        class_name="TextChunk",
        vector=embedding
    )
```


---

## **How Embeddings Are Formatted**

- **Embeddings** are stored as lists of floats, e.g., `[0.123, -0.456, ...]`.
- In Weaviate, each object (here, a text chunk) has:
    - A `content` property (your text)
    - A `vector` property (the embedding, as a list of floats)
- This format enables efficient similarity search and retrieval in Weaviate.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | What Happens |
| :-- | :-- |
| Docker runs Weaviate | Local vector DB with REST API on localhost:8080 |
| Python connects to Weaviate | Using `weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")` |
| Embeddings generated | As lists of floats (e.g., `[0.1, -0.2, ...]`) |
| Data stored in Weaviate | Each chunk: text + embedding vector |


---

**In short:**
You chunk your text, generate embeddings, and store both text and embedding in Weaviate, where the embedding is simply a list of floats attached to each object. This setup lets you efficiently search and retrieve semantically similar text using Weaviate’s API[^10_5][^10_7][^10_8].

# For documents ranging between 3 and 500 pages, is it better to first perform chunking and then named entity recognition on these chunks, or is it possible to do this the other way around? What are the best practices for chunking and named entity extraction in the way that we discussed previously?

For documents ranging from 3 to 500 pages, **the best practice is to first perform chunking and then apply named entity recognition (NER) to each chunk**. Here’s why and how this approach aligns with both technical constraints and NLP standards:

---

## **Why Chunk First, Then NER?**

- **Scalability:**
NER models (especially those using deep learning) have practical limits on input size due to memory and context window constraints. Processing a whole multi-page document at once is often infeasible and inefficient[^11_1][^11_2][^11_5].
- **Context Preservation:**
Chunking the document into semantically coherent sections (paragraphs, sentences, or topic-based chunks) ensures that each chunk provides enough context for accurate entity recognition, but is not so large that it overwhelms the model. This is especially important for disambiguating entities (e.g., distinguishing “Apple” as a company vs. a fruit)[^11_2].
- **NER Model Design:**
Most NER models are trained on sentence or paragraph-level text, not entire documents[^11_2][^11_5]. Applying NER to appropriately sized chunks aligns with how these models are intended to be used.
- **Efficiency:**
Chunking first allows for parallel or batched processing, making large-scale extraction practical.

---

## **Is the Reverse Possible?**

- **NER Before Chunking:**
Technically, you could run NER on the entire document (if small enough), then chunk based on entity boundaries or types. However, this is rarely practical for large documents due to memory and context limitations, and risks losing context needed for correct entity disambiguation and relationship extraction.

---

## **Best Practices for Chunking and NER**

1. **Chunking:**
    - **Semantic Chunking:** Use semantic or paragraph-based chunking to maintain topic coherence, as discussed previously.
    - **Chunk Size:** Choose a chunk size that fits within your NER model’s context window (often a few sentences to a few paragraphs).
    - **Overlap:** Consider overlapping chunks slightly to avoid losing entities that span chunk boundaries.
2. **NER on Chunks:**
    - **Apply NER to Each Chunk:** Run your NER pipeline (e.g., spaCy, transformer model) on each chunk independently.
    - **Aggregate Results:** After NER, aggregate and, if needed, post-process entities to merge duplicates and resolve cross-chunk references.
3. **Advanced:**
    - **Disambiguation:** Use context within each chunk and, if needed, across neighboring chunks for global entity disambiguation.
    - **Relationship Extraction:** Once entities are identified in each chunk, extract roles and relationships (e.g., person’s role in an organization) as a downstream step.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | Why? | Best Practice |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Chunk first | Fits model limits, preserves context, scalable | Semantic/paragraph chunking |
| NER on chunk | Accurate, efficient, aligns with model training | Use NER per chunk, then aggregate |
| NER first | Only for very short texts; not scalable/practical | Not recommended for long documents |


---

**In summary:**
For large documents, always chunk first-using semantic or paragraph-based chunking-then apply NER to each chunk. This approach is robust, scalable, and aligns with both research and industry best practices[^11_1][^11_2][^11_5].

# Is it possible to use the embeddings generated during the semantic chunking to help with the entity recognition and global entity linking / disambiguation?

Yes, it is possible-and increasingly effective-to use the embeddings generated during semantic chunking to assist with both **entity recognition** and especially **global entity linking/disambiguation**.

---

## How Embeddings Can Help

### 1. **Entity Recognition (NER)**

- **Direct Use:** Most standard NER models (like spaCy or transformers) do not directly use chunk-level embeddings for entity recognition; they rely on token-level or contextual embeddings within the model itself[^12_5].
- **Potential Use:** However, chunk embeddings can be used as additional features in custom or advanced NER pipelines, especially when using neural models that can take external semantic context into account. For example, if a chunk embedding signals a particular topic or domain, it could help bias the NER model toward relevant entity types[^12_6][^12_8].


### 2. **Global Entity Linking / Disambiguation**

- **Contextual Clues:** Chunk embeddings capture the semantic context of the chunk, which is crucial for disambiguating entities that may have multiple meanings (e.g., “Apple” as a company vs. a fruit)[^12_6][^12_8].
- **Similarity-Based Linking:** By comparing the embedding of a chunk (or the embedding of an entity mention within its chunk) with embeddings of candidate entities (e.g., from a knowledge base like Wikipedia), you can select the candidate whose embedding is most similar to the context. This is a common approach in modern entity linking systems[^12_6].
- **Augmenting Entity Embeddings:** Research shows that combining entity embeddings with semantic (chunk or type) embeddings improves the ability of models to link mentions to the correct global entity, especially when context is ambiguous[^12_6].

> "We propose a simple yet effective method... to inject fine-grained semantic information into entity embeddings... and then combine them with existing entity embeddings through linear aggregation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of such embeddings. Based on our entity embeddings, we achieved new state-of-the-art performance on entity linking."[^12_6]

- **Late Chunking Advantage:** Newer methods such as "late chunking" (embedding the whole document first, then chunking) further improve the contextualization of embeddings, making them even more useful for entity disambiguation tasks[^12_8].

---

## **Best Practices**

- **Chunk First, Then NER:** As discussed previously, chunk the document semantically, then run NER on each chunk.
- **Leverage Chunk Embeddings for Linking:** Use the chunk embeddings to provide context for entity linking-either by direct similarity search with candidate entity embeddings, or as features in a neural linking model[^12_6][^12_8].
- **Augmenting NER:** For advanced pipelines, consider using chunk embeddings to inform NER models about the broader context, especially in custom or research settings.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Task | Can Use Chunk Embeddings? | How? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Named Entity Recognition | Possible (advanced/custom) | As additional features/context for NER models |
| Global Entity Linking | Yes (recommended) | For context-aware similarity search and disambiguation |


---

**In summary:**

- **Embeddings from semantic chunking are highly valuable for global entity linking and disambiguation,** as they encode the context needed to resolve ambiguous mentions[^12_6][^12_8].
- For standard NER, chunk embeddings are less commonly used directly, but can enhance custom or advanced pipelines.
- Modern best practice is to use chunk embeddings as contextual signals in entity linking workflows, improving accuracy and robustness.

# Show how to implement late chunking using langchain and ollama and store the resulting embeddings in weaviate along with an ID

Here’s how to implement **late chunking** using LangChain and Ollama, then store the resulting chunk embeddings in a Weaviate database along with a unique ID for each chunk.

---

## **How Late Chunking Works**

- **Late chunking** first embeds the entire document (so every token’s embedding is contextualized by the whole document)[^13_3][^13_5][^13_8].
- After embedding, you split the document into chunks (e.g., by sentences or paragraphs).
- For each chunk, you pool (average) the embeddings of the tokens that belong to the chunk, producing a single embedding per chunk.
- This approach preserves more global context in each chunk’s embedding, improving downstream retrieval and disambiguation[^13_2][^13_3][^13_8].

---

## **Implementation Steps**

### 1. **Obtain Token Embeddings for the Whole Document**

LangChain does not (as of now) natively expose token-level embeddings for Ollama models, but you can use HuggingFace-compatible models for this purpose or adapt the Ollama API if it supports token-level outputs. For demonstration, here’s how you’d do it with HuggingFace-style models (the logic is the same for Ollama if it exposes token embeddings):

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch
import numpy as np

# Load your embedding model (replace with Ollama if supported)
model_name = "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

text = open("your_file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8").read()
tokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True)
with torch.no_grad():
    model_output = model(**tokens)
token_embeddings = model_output.last_hidden_state.squeeze(0)  # [num_tokens, hidden_size]
```


### 2. **Chunk the Document (After Embedding)**

Split the text into chunks (e.g., by sentence or paragraph) and map each chunk to its corresponding token span.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
tokenized_sentences = [tokenizer(sentence, return_tensors='pt', add_special_tokens=False) for sentence in sentences]

# Compute start/end token indices for each sentence
spans = []
idx = 0
for ts in tokenized_sentences:
    length = ts['input_ids'].shape[^13_1]
    spans.append((idx, idx+length))
    idx += length
```


### 3. **Compute Chunk Embeddings (Mean Pooling)**

For each chunk, average its tokens’ embeddings.

```python
chunk_embeddings = []
for start, end in spans:
    chunk_emb = token_embeddings[start:end].mean(dim=0)
    chunk_embeddings.append(chunk_emb.numpy())
```


### 4. **Store Chunks and Embeddings in Weaviate**

Set up Weaviate and store each chunk with a unique ID and its embedding.

```python
import weaviate
import uuid

# Connect to Weaviate running locally
client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")

# Define schema if needed
class_obj = {
    "class": "LateChunk",
    "vectorizer": "none",
    "properties": [
        {"name": "content", "dataType": ["text"]},
        {"name": "chunk_id", "dataType": ["text"]}
    ]
}
if not client.schema.exists("LateChunk"):
    client.schema.create_class(class_obj)

# Store each chunk
for i, (sentence, embedding) in enumerate(zip(sentences, chunk_embeddings)):
    chunk_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    properties = {"content": sentence, "chunk_id": chunk_id}
    client.data_object.create(
        properties=properties,
        class_name="LateChunk",
        vector=embedding.tolist()
    )
```


---

## **How Embeddings Are Formatted**

- Each embedding is a **list of floats** (e.g., `[0.123, -0.456, ...]`), typically of dimension 768 or 1024 depending on the model.
- In Weaviate, each object (chunk) stores:
    - A unique `chunk_id`
    - The chunk’s text (`content`)
    - The chunk’s embedding (`vector` field)

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1. Embed whole document | Get token-level embeddings with full-document context |
| 2. Chunk after embedding | Split text into sentences/paragraphs, map to token spans |
| 3. Pool token embeddings | Average token embeddings for each chunk to get chunk embedding |
| 4. Store in Weaviate | Save chunk text, ID, and embedding as a Weaviate object |


---

**Note:**

- If Ollama exposes token-level embeddings, adapt the above to use its API; otherwise, use a HuggingFace model as shown.
- For large documents, ensure your model and hardware can handle the full document context; otherwise, process in manageable batches.

# Can the hugging face models also be ran locally? Provide a guide for how to use the jinaAI embedding model locally to generate these embeddings and explain the limits of how feasible this method is for long documents (what are the approximate page size limits based on the token limits?). Also estimate how much time such processing would take compared to regular embedding and chuncking based on different hardware

Yes, Hugging Face models-**including JinaAI embedding models**-can be run completely locally. Here’s a practical guide for generating embeddings locally with `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3-base-en` (or similar), along with feasibility notes for long documents and an estimate of processing times compared to conventional chunking.

---

## 1. **Running Hugging Face Embedding Models Locally**

### **Installation and Setup**

1. **Install dependencies (with GPU support if available):**

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

2. **Download the model for offline use:**

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
model_name = "jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3-base-en"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
```

This will cache the model locally; you can then use it offline[^14_2][^14_4][^14_6][^14_7].
3. **Generate embeddings:**

```python
import torch

text = "This is a test document."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
# For most embedding models, use the [CLS] token or mean-pool the output
embedding = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).squeeze().numpy()
print(embedding.shape)  # Typically 768 or 1024 dimensions
```


---

## 2. **Feasibility for Long Documents (Late Chunking)**

### **Token Limits**

- **Transformers models** have a maximum context window (token limit), typically **512, 1024, or up to 4096 tokens** for some newer models.
- **JinaAI embedding models**: v2/v3 base models usually support up to **8192 tokens** (check the model card for specifics).
- **A standard page** of text is about **300–500 words** (~400–700 tokens).
- **Maximum document size:** For an 8k token limit, you can process about **10–15 pages** at once. For a 2k token limit, about **3 pages**.


### **Implications**

- **Late chunking** (embedding the whole document, then splitting) is only feasible for documents that fit within the model’s token limit.
- For **documents >10–15 pages**, you must process in batches or revert to classic chunk-then-embed workflows.

---

## 3. **Performance Estimates**

### **Time per Embedding**

- **Regular chunking:** Each chunk (e.g., paragraph) is embedded independently. Fast, parallelizable, and each chunk fits easily in context window.
- **Late chunking:** Embedding the whole document at once (if it fits) is slower per call, and may require more memory, but gives better context for each chunk.


### **Relative Speed (Approximate)**

| Hardware | Regular Chunking (per chunk) | Late Chunking (per document) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| CPU (modern, 8-core) | ~0.2–0.5s | 2–10s for max-length doc |
| GPU (consumer, e.g. RTX 3060) | ~0.05–0.1s | 0.5–2s for max-length doc |
| GPU (A100, server) | <0.05s | <1s for max-length doc |

- **Late chunking is slower per document** but may be faster overall if fewer calls are made.
- **Memory use:** Late chunking requires enough RAM/VRAM to hold the entire document’s tokens and model weights.

---

## 4. **Summary Table: Token Limits and Page Size**

| Model Token Limit | Approx. Max Pages (single pass) |
| :-- | :-- |
| 512 | 1 |
| 2048 | 3–4 |
| 4096 | 6–8 |
| 8192 | 10–15 |

## 5. **Best Practice Workflow for Local JinaAI Embeddings**

1. **For documents < token limit:**
    - Embed the whole document, then split and pool embeddings for late chunking.
2. **For longer documents:**
    - Split into overlapping windows that fit the token limit, then apply late chunking within each window, or revert to classic chunk-first-then-embed.

- [JinaAI Embeddings documentation][^14_8][^14_9]

---

**In summary:**
You can run Hugging Face embedding models, including JinaAI, fully locally. Late chunking is feasible for documents up to the model’s token limit (typically 3–15 pages). For longer documents, classic chunk-then-embed is necessary. GPU acceleration significantly speeds up processing, but memory and token limits are the main constraints for late chunking.

# Implement a full script which uses the local hugging face model jina-embeddings-v3 in german to chunck documents using late chunking.

It should take text files as input and before processing it should check if it has less than 8000 tokens. If it is under, proceed with the whole document for late chunking and if it exceeds it, implement a splitting into overlapping windows that fit into the token limit.
At the end it should store the embeddings for each chunk in weavate as specified before with an ID, and also store the embeddings of the entire document under a separate ID.

Here is a full Python script that performs **late chunking** with the local Hugging Face model `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3-base-de` (German, but the multilingual model supports German natively[^15_1][^15_6][^15_7]), handling long documents by splitting into overlapping windows if the document exceeds 8,000 tokens, and storing all chunk and document embeddings in Weaviate with unique IDs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `torch`, `transformers`, `weaviate-client`, `nltk`
- Weaviate running locally on `localhost:8080`
- Sufficient RAM/VRAM for large documents

```bash
pip install torch transformers weaviate-client nltk
```

## **How It Works**

- **Checks token count**: If ≤8192, embeds the whole document, then splits into sentence-level chunks and pools embeddings for each chunk.
- **If >8192 tokens**: Splits into overlapping windows (default overlap: 256 tokens), embeds each window, and does late chunking within each window.
- **Stores**: Each chunk embedding (with unique chunk and doc ID) in Weaviate (`LateChunk` class), and the full-document embedding (mean of window embeddings if windowed) in `DocumentEmbedding`.
- **Language**: Uses German-specific tokenization and the German version of the Jina model, but the approach is valid for any supported language.

# Is it possible to create chunks that are longer than one sentence using this method and are instead chunks which comprise paragraphs of varying lengths based on semantic coherence? There are also local llm models available through ollama if required to determine the semantic coherence of sentences.

If it is possible, implement it in the above script

Yes, it is possible-and recommended-to create variable-length, semantically coherent chunks that are longer than one sentence, such as full paragraphs or multi-sentence sections, using **semantic chunking** rather than simple sentence or paragraph splitting[^16_1][^16_3][^16_4][^16_5]. This approach groups sentences into chunks based on their semantic similarity, ensuring each chunk represents a coherent idea or topic, and can yield much better results for retrieval and downstream LLM tasks.

You can implement this by:

- Splitting the document into sentences.
- Generating embeddings for each sentence.
- Iteratively grouping sentences into a chunk until the semantic similarity (cosine distance) between the last sentence and the next exceeds a threshold, or a token limit is reached.
- Optionally, you can use a local LLM (via Ollama) to further refine or validate chunk boundaries if needed[^16_6][^16_9].

Below is an updated script that performs **semantic chunking** using Hugging Face for embeddings and optionally Ollama for semantic coherence scoring. The script:

- Reads a text file.
- Splits into sentences.
- Embeds each sentence.
- Groups sentences into semantically coherent chunks (variable length, paragraph-like).
- Handles long documents by windowing if needed.
- Stores chunk and document embeddings in Weaviate.

## **How This Works**

- **Semantic chunking**: Groups sentences into variable-length, semantically coherent chunks using cosine similarity of sentence embeddings[^16_1][^16_3][^16_5].
- **Paragraph/section-level chunks**: Chunks are not fixed to single sentences or paragraphs, but adapt to the text’s meaning and token limits.
- **Handles long documents**: Splits into overlapping windows if the document exceeds the token limit.
- **Stores in Weaviate**: Each chunk and the whole document embedding are stored with unique IDs.

---

**To further refine chunk boundaries using a local LLM (e.g., via Ollama), you could prompt the LLM to suggest chunk boundaries based on the text or sentence list, but for most use cases, embedding-based semantic chunking as shown here is robust and efficient[^16_5][^16_6][^16_8].**

# Does this script still use the late chunking method?

No, the most recent script you provided **does not strictly use the late chunking method as defined in the literature and your search results**[^17_1][^17_2][^17_4][^17_5][^17_6]. Instead, it uses **semantic chunking before embedding**: it splits the document into sentences, groups them into semantically coherent chunks based on sentence embeddings, and then embeds each chunk separately.

---

## Why This Is Not Late Chunking

**Late chunking** (per your sources[^17_1][^17_2][^17_4][^17_5][^17_6]) means:

- **First**: Embed the entire document (or window) at the token level, so every token's embedding is computed in the context of the full document.
- **Then**: Apply your chunking algorithm to the sequence of token embeddings, pooling (e.g., mean pooling) the relevant token embeddings to get each chunk embedding.

**The script instead:**

- Splits into sentences.
- Embeds each sentence (in isolation, or in small batches).
- Groups sentences into chunks based on the similarity of their embeddings.
- Pools these sentence embeddings to get chunk embeddings.

**This is a form of semantic chunking, but it is not late chunking** because the chunk embeddings do **not** have access to the full-document context-they only see the context of their own sentence or chunk.

---

## What True Late Chunking Would Look Like

- You would tokenize the entire document (or window).
- Pass all tokens through the embedding model in a single forward pass, obtaining a sequence of token embeddings, each contextualized by the entire document.
- Then, define your chunk boundaries (e.g., by paragraph, semantic coherence, or other cues).
- For each chunk, pool the relevant token embeddings (e.g., mean pooling over the tokens in the chunk) to get the chunk embedding.
- This preserves global context in every chunk embedding, as described in your sources[^17_1][^17_2][^17_4][^17_5][^17_6].

---

## Supporting Quotes from Search Results

> "Late Chunking...delays the chunking process until after the embedding model has processed the entire text, preserving the context across chunks and resulting in higher-quality embeddings."[^17_1]

> "Late Chunking is a technique that applies chunking after the entire document has been processed by a long-context embedding model."[^17_2]

> "Late chunking...first, encodes all tokens of an entire document with their full in-document context into a sequence of token embeddings, and then breaks this sequence up into chunks, which receive embeddings via mean pooling of their token embeddings."[^17_4]

---

## Summary Table

| Approach in Script | True Late Chunking? | Why/Why Not |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Semantic chunking, then embedding | ❌ | Chunks are embedded independently, not with global context |
| Late chunking (embed first, then chunk) | ✅ | All token embeddings have full-document context, then are pooled |


---

**In summary:**
The script as written does not use late chunking: it chunks (and embeds) before the embedding step, not after. To implement true late chunking, you must embed the entire document (or window) first, then pool token embeddings into chunk embeddings according to your chunk boundaries[^17_1][^17_2][^17_4][^17_5][^17_6].

# Modify the latest script to instead use late chunking as the previous one, while maintaining variable paragraph level semantic chunking

Here’s a revised script that **implements true late chunking** while maintaining **variable, semantically coherent, paragraph-level chunking**. This means:

- The entire document (or window, if over the token limit) is embedded at once to get token-level embeddings, so every chunk embedding is contextualized by the whole document.
- Chunks are determined by grouping sentences into variable-length, semantically coherent groups (using cosine similarity between sentence embeddings).
- After chunk boundaries are set, you map those boundaries to token spans, then pool the corresponding token embeddings for each chunk.

This approach is supported by your search results[^18_1][^18_3][^18_4][^18_5][^18_7][^18_9].

---

## Script Outline

1. **Tokenize the document** and get sentence/paragraph boundaries.
2. **Generate sentence embeddings** for semantic grouping.
3. **Group sentences into variable-length, semantically coherent chunks** (e.g., using a similarity threshold).
4. **Map chunk boundaries to token indices**.
5. **Embed the entire document** to get token-level embeddings.
6. **Pool token embeddings for each chunk** to get chunk embeddings.
7. **Store chunk and document embeddings in Weaviate**.

## How This Script Implements True Late Chunking with Semantic Chunks

- **Embeds the entire document (or window) at once**, yielding token-level embeddings contextualized by the whole input[^18_1][^18_3][^18_4][^18_7][^18_9].
- **Determines chunk boundaries based on semantic coherence between sentences** (cosine similarity of sentence embeddings), so chunks are variable-length and paragraph-like[^18_10].
- **Pools token embeddings for each chunk** (using mean pooling) to get the final chunk embedding[^18_1][^18_4][^18_5][^18_7][^18_9].
- **Handles long documents** by windowing and overlapping as needed[^18_1][^18_6][^18_9].
- **Stores chunk and document embeddings in Weaviate** with unique IDs.

---

**This approach preserves global context in each chunk embedding, and the chunking is variable and semantically meaningful, as per your requirements and best practices from the literature.**

# When executing this code it returns the error:

Python client v3 `weaviate.Client(...)` has been removed.

Upgrade your code to use Python client v4 `weaviate.WeaviateClient` connections and methods.

When adapting this in the code it returns the error:
TypeError: connection_params is expected to be a ConnectionParams object but is <class 'str'>

Can you patch this to be compatible with the latest WeaviateClient? Don't change anything else about the script

To patch your script for compatibility with the latest **Weaviate Python client v4**, you must:

- Use `weaviate.WeaviateClient` instead of `weaviate.Client`.
- Use a `ConnectionParams` object for the connection, not a plain string.
- Use the new API for schema and data operations.

Below is a minimal patch for the Weaviate connection and usage, **leaving all other logic unchanged**.

---

### **Patch for Weaviate v4 Client**

**Add these imports at the top:**

```python
import weaviate
from weaviate.connect import ConnectionParams
```

**Replace the old connection code:**

```python
# Old (v3):
# client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")
```

**With the new (v4):**

```python
client = weaviate.WeaviateClient(
    connection_params=ConnectionParams.from_http(
        host="localhost",
        port=8080,
        grpc_port=50051,  # default gRPC port
        secure=False
    )
)
```


---

**Schema and data operations:**

- For schema: use `client.collections.create` and `client.collections.exists`.
- For adding objects: use `client.collections.get("CollectionName").data.insert(...)`.

**Patch your schema creation and insertion as follows:**

```python
# Schema creation
if not client.collections.exists("LateChunk"):
    client.collections.create(
        name="LateChunk",
        properties=[
            {"name": "content", "dataType": "text"},
            {"name": "chunk_id", "dataType": "text"},
            {"name": "doc_id", "dataType": "text"}
        ],
        vectorizer_config={"vectorizer": "none"}
    )

if not client.collections.exists("DocumentEmbedding"):
    client.collections.create(
        name="DocumentEmbedding",
        properties=[
            {"name": "doc_id", "dataType": "text"},
            {"name": "file_name", "dataType": "text"}
        ],
        vectorizer_config={"vectorizer": "none"}
    )
```

**Patch your object creation as follows:**

```python
client.collections.get("LateChunk").data.insert(
    properties={"content": chunk_text, "chunk_id": chunk_id, "doc_id": doc_id},
    vector=chunk_emb.tolist()
)

client.collections.get("DocumentEmbedding").data.insert(
    properties={"doc_id": doc_id, "file_name": file_name},
    vector=doc_emb.tolist()
)
```


---

## **Summary of Required Changes**

1. **Connection:**

```python
import weaviate
from weaviate.connect import ConnectionParams

client = weaviate.WeaviateClient(
    connection_params=ConnectionParams.from_http(
        host="localhost", port=8080, grpc_port=50051, secure=False
    )
)
```

2. **Schema creation:**

```python
if not client.collections.exists("LateChunk"):
    client.collections.create(
        name="LateChunk",
        properties=[
            {"name": "content", "dataType": "text"},
            {"name": "chunk_id", "dataType": "text"},
            {"name": "doc_id", "dataType": "text"}
        ],
        vectorizer_config={"vectorizer": "none"}
    )
```

3. **Data insertion:**

```python
client.collections.get("LateChunk").data.insert(
    properties={"content": chunk_text, "chunk_id": chunk_id, "doc_id": doc_id},
    vector=chunk_emb.tolist()
)
```

# This now returns the error Traceback (most recent call last):

File "c:\Users\Silvan\Documents\Obsidian Fusion\Uni\CAS Data Engineering\OCR-Processing-Pipeline\Chunker\late_chunker.py", line 22, in <module>
connection_params=ConnectionParams.from_http(
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

raise AttributeError(item)
AttributeError: from_http

The error occurs because the latest Weaviate Python client v4 **no longer provides `ConnectionParams.from_http`**.
Instead, you should use **`ConnectionParams.from_params`** as described in the [official documentation][^20_3].

Here is the minimal patch for your script:

---

### **Replace your Weaviate client initialization with:**

```python
import weaviate
from weaviate.connect import ConnectionParams

client = weaviate.WeaviateClient(
    connection_params=ConnectionParams.from_params(
        http_host="localhost",
        http_port=8080,
        http_secure=False,
        grpc_host="localhost",
        grpc_port=50051,
        grpc_secure=False,
    )
)
client.connect()
```


---

- This uses `from_params` instead of `from_http`.
- After instantiating, you must call `client.connect()` to establish the connection.

**All other code remains unchanged.**

---

**References:**

- [Weaviate Python Client v4 Docs][^20_3]

---

This will resolve the `AttributeError: from_http` and connect you to your local Weaviate instance using the v4 client.

# This time it failed due to the grpc port. It returns the error:

weaviate.exceptions.WeaviateGRPCUnavailableError:
Weaviate v1.30.3 makes use of a high-speed gRPC API as well as a REST API.
Unfortunately, the gRPC health check against Weaviate could not be completed.

This error could be due to one of several reasons:

- The gRPC traffic at the specified port is blocked by a firewall.
- gRPC is not enabled or incorrectly configured on the server or the client.
    - Please check that the server address and port (localhost:50051) are correct.
- your connection is unstable or has a high latency. In this case you can:
    - increase init-timeout in `weaviate.connect_to_local(additional_config=wvc.init.AdditionalConfig(timeout=wvc.init.Timeout(init=X)))`
    - disable startup checks by connecting using `skip_init_checks=True`

How do I fix this? I am hosting weaviate in docker and have not worked with grpc ports previously

The error means your Weaviate Docker instance is not exposing the gRPC port (`50051`) to your host, so the Python client cannot connect to it.

## **How to Fix**

### 1. **Update your Docker Compose or Docker Run Command**

You must explicitly expose the gRPC port in your Docker configuration.
Your `docker-compose.yml` (or Docker run command) should include:

```yaml
services:
  weaviate:
    image: semitechnologies/weaviate:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"   # REST API
      - "50051:50051" # gRPC API
    environment:
      # ... your other env vars
      ENABLE_GRPC: "true"  # Optional, but recommended for some versions
```

If you’re using `docker run` directly:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50051:50051 semitechnologies/weaviate:latest
```

**After updating, restart your Weaviate container.**

---

### 2. **Verify gRPC is Enabled**

- Make sure your Weaviate version is **v1.23.7 or later** (gRPC support).
- The environment variable `ENABLE_GRPC` should be set to `"true"` for some versions, but recent versions enable gRPC by default.

---

### 3. **Check Local Port Availability**

- Ensure no firewall or security software is blocking port 50051 on your host.
- You can check if Weaviate is listening on 50051:

```bash
netstat -an | grep 50051
```

or on Windows:

```powershell
netstat -an | findstr 50051
```


---

### 4. **Client Connection Example (Python v4 Client)**

```python
import weaviate

client = weaviate.WeaviateClient(
    host="localhost",
    port=8080,
    grpc_port=50051,
    http_secure=False,
    grpc_secure=False,
)
client.connect()
```

- This will use both REST and gRPC APIs.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | What to do |
| :-- | :-- |
| Expose gRPC port | `- "50051:50051"` in Docker config |
| Enable gRPC | Set `ENABLE_GRPC: "true"` if needed |
| Check version | Use Weaviate v1.23.7 or later |
| Restart container | After changing ports or env variables |
| Client config | Use `grpc_port=50051` in Python client |


---

**Once these steps are complete, your client should connect without the gRPC health check error.**

# docker: error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.

The error:

```
docker: error during connect: Head "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

means **Docker Desktop is not running**, or its service/daemon is not available to your terminal or scripts[^22_2][^22_3][^22_6][^22_7].

---

## How to Fix

### 1. **Start Docker Desktop**

- Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
- On Windows, click the Docker Desktop icon to launch it. Wait until it says "Docker Desktop is running" or similar.
- If it’s stuck on "Starting...", try quitting and restarting Docker Desktop.


### 2. **Restart the Docker Service**

- Open **Windows Services** (`services.msc` from the Start menu).
- Find **Docker Desktop Service**.
- Right-click and select **Restart**.


### 3. **Check WSL (if using WSL2 backend)**

- Open a terminal and run:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

- Then restart Docker Desktop.


### 4. **Reboot Your Computer**

- A full reboot often resolves issues where sockets or services are stuck.


### 5. **Check for Updates**

- Ensure Docker Desktop and WSL (if used) are up to date.


### 6. **Permissions**

- Make sure your user is in the `docker` group, or run your terminal as administrator.


### 7. **Advanced: Reset Docker Desktop**

- Go to Docker Desktop → Settings → Troubleshoot → "Restart Docker Desktop" or "Reset to factory defaults" (last resort).

---

## Why This Happens

- Docker Desktop (on Windows) runs a Linux VM in the background and exposes the Docker Engine via a named pipe.
- If Docker Desktop is not running, or the pipe is missing, you get this error[^22_2][^22_3][^22_6].

---

## Summary Table

| Step | What to Do |
| :-- | :-- |
| Start Docker Desktop | Ensure it's running and not stuck on "Starting" |
| Restart Docker Desktop Service | Via Windows Services |
| Restart WSL | `wsl --shutdown` then restart Docker Desktop |
| Reboot | Restart your computer |
| Update | Ensure Docker Desktop and WSL are up to date |
| Reset Docker Desktop (last resort) | Via Troubleshoot settings |


---

**If you follow these steps, Docker commands should work again from your terminal.**
If problems persist after all these steps, consider uninstalling and reinstalling Docker Desktop and WSL[^22_5][^22_8].

Your error comes from the fact that the **Weaviate Python client v4 expects properties to be defined using the Property and DataType classes, not plain dicts**.
Also, the vectorizer configuration must use the correct enum, not a string.

Here's how to patch your collection/“schema” creation for compatibility with Weaviate v4:

---

## **Correct Way to Define Properties and Vectorizer in Weaviate v4**

```python
from weaviate.classes.config import Property, DataType, Vectorizer

# For the LateChunk collection
if not client.collections.exists("LateChunk"):
    client.collections.create(
        name="LateChunk",
        properties=[
            Property(name="content", data_type=DataType.TEXT),
            Property(name="chunk_id", data_type=DataType.TEXT),
            Property(name="doc_id", data_type=DataType.TEXT)
        ],
        vectorizer=Vectorizer.NONE
    )

# For the DocumentEmbedding collection
if not client.collections.exists("DocumentEmbedding"):
    client.collections.create(
        name="DocumentEmbedding",
        properties=[
            Property(name="doc_id", data_type=DataType.TEXT),
            Property(name="file_name", data_type=DataType.TEXT)
        ],
        vectorizer=Vectorizer.NONE
    )
```


---

## **Key Points**

- Use `Property(...)` and `DataType.TEXT` (not `"text"` as a string).
- Use `vectorizer=Vectorizer.NONE` (not `"none"` as a string or dict).
- This matches the [official Weaviate v4 Python client documentation][^23_1].

---

## **References**

- [Weaviate v4 Python client: Manage collections][^23_1]
- [Weaviate v4 Python client: Data types][^23_2]

---

**Replace only your collection creation code with the above, and your script will work with the latest Weaviate client.**

how do I resolve this?

The error you are seeing:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\Users\\Silvan\\.cache\\huggingface\\modules\\transformers_modules\\jinaai\\xlm-roberta-flash-implementation\\2b6bc3f30750b3a9648fe9b63448c09920efe9be\\rotary.py'
```

is **not a standard "ModuleNotFoundError"** for `transformers` itself, but a **file missing from the dynamic module download** for the JinaAI embedding model. This is a known issue with some Hugging Face models that use `trust_remote_code=True` and custom code, especially on Windows.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. **Clear the Transformers and Hugging Face Cache**

Corrupted or incomplete downloads can cause this error. Clear the cache and try again:

```bash
# Clear Hugging Face cache
rmdir /s /q %USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface
rmdir /s /q %USERPROFILE%\.cache\torch
```

Or manually delete the `C:\Users\Silvan\.cache\huggingface` directory.

Then try running your script again.

---

### 2. **Update transformers and huggingface-hub**

Make sure you have the latest versions, as older versions have more issues with dynamic modules:

```bash
pip install --upgrade transformers huggingface-hub
```


---

### 3. **Try a Different Model Variant**

Some JinaAI models (especially those with `trust_remote_code=True`) may have issues on Windows. If possible, try a different embedding model that does **not** require remote code, or use a Linux environment (even WSL2 on Windows).

---

### 4. **If You Must Use This Model on Windows**

- Ensure you are using Python 3.10 or 3.11 (some models have issues with 3.12).
- Try running the script in an **Anaconda environment** or **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux), where dynamic code loading is more reliable.
- If the error persists, it may be a bug in the model's Hugging Face repository. You can open an issue on the [JinaAI model page](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3-base-de/discussions) or [Hugging Face forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/).

---

### 5. **General Advice**

- This is **not** a simple missing package error (like [^24_1][^24_2][^24_3][^24_4][^24_5]), but a missing file in the model's custom code. Clearing cache and updating packages usually resolves it.
- If you see persistent issues, try on Linux or WSL2, or switch to a model that does not require `trust_remote_code=True`.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | Command/Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Clear cache | Delete `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface` |
| Update packages | `pip install --upgrade transformers huggingface-hub` |
| Try Python 3.10+ | Use Python 3.10 or 3.11, not 3.12 |
| Use Linux/WSL2 | Try in WSL2 or a Linux VM |
| Try other model | Use a different embedding model if possible |


---
